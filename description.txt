Have you ever thought to yourself:
"Man, terraria's reforge mechanic is a little bit too random for me!"?
Then, my friend, this tiny mod might be the mod for you!

This mod currently adds three items:
- a "dormant" moonstone, which is basically a lootbag (that stacks)
- two versions of awakened moonstone, that will spawn from right-clicking (=opening) a dormant one
	- accessory moonstones will let you apply modifiers to accessories
	- [NEW!] weapon moonstones will let you apply modifiers to weapons

At this point, enemies have a hardcoded 2.5% chance to drop a dormant moonstone, that you can later (when you
find yourself having the inventory space) awaken. Awakened moonstone do not stack, but spawn with a guaranteed
prefix/modifier. When you right-click an awakened moonstone, it will try to apply its prefix
to your held item. For this to work, you need to hold an accessory or a weapon that is able to accept that modifier.

This mod should serve as an alternative to the boring reforge mechanic the goblin tinkerer offers, but it doesn't
aim to replace it. Moonstones are simply a way of manually applying modifiers.

Currently this mod doesn't feature a config file, but I will try to implement one if I ever find out how.
I'm finally back improving on the mod. Latest changes include the previously disabled weapon moonstone and shiny new tooltips for it.
If you find any bugs (and I'm sure you will, since I build
this mod in less than a day), you can open a new issue on github: https://github.com/Beetrootmonkey/Moonstones/issues

Cheers.
