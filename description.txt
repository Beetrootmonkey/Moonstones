Have you ever thought to yourself:
"Man, terraria's reforge mechanic is a little bit too random for me!"?
Then, my friend, this tiny mod might be the mod for you!

This mod currently adds two items:
- a "dormant" moonstone, which is basically a lootbag (that stacks)
- an awakened moonstone, that will spawn from right-clicking (=opening) a dormant one

At this point, enemies have a hardcoded 1% chance to drop a dormant moonstone, that you can later (when you
find yourself having the inventory space) awaken. Awakened moonstone do not stack, but spawn with a guaranteed
accessory-specific prefix/modifier. When you right-click an awakened moonstone, it will try to apply its prefix
to your held item. For this to work, you need to hold an accessory; otherwise right-clicking will simply return
the moonstone (so you don't accidentally waste it on items that can't receive modifiers).

This mod should serve as an alternative to the boring reforge mechanic the goblin tinkerer offers, but it doesn't
aim to replace it. Moonstones are simply a way of manually applying modifiers.

Currently this mod doesn't feature a config file, but I will try to implement one if I ever find out how.
I tested this mod in singleplayer only so far. If you find any bugs (and I'm sure you will, since I build
this mod in less than a day), you can open a new issue on github: https://github.com/Beetrootmonkey/Moonstones/issues

Cheers.
